# Entropy

This is an example of entropy in a system. All atoms are in one box. This box is connected to a second (empty) box by a small slit. Every atom has a percent chance of crossing over to the other box.

The box with more atoms has a higher percentage chance that one of those atoms will cross to the other side while the box with less atoms has a lower chance. This eventually leads to both boxes containing similar numbers of atoms.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
bower install
node app.js
```

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
